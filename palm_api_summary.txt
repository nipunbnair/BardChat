 Transformer is a new neural network architecture for sequence transduction tasks. It is based on attention mechanisms and does not use recurrence or convolutions. It achieves state-of-the-art results on machine translation and constituency parsing tasks.

 Transformer is a new neural network architecture for sequence transduction tasks. It eschews recurrence and instead relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.

 Transformer model consists of encoder and decoder stacks. Encoder stack has 6 identical layers, each with 2 sub-layers: multi-head self-attention and position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. Decoder stack has 3 sub-layers: multi-head self-attention, multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack and position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.

 Attention is a mechanism that allows an AI model to focus on specific parts of a input sequence.
It is used in the Transformer model to improve performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks.

 Transformer model consists of an encoder and decoder, each containing a stack of identical layers.
The encoder layers contain multi-head attention and feed-forward networks. The decoder layers
contain multi-head attention, feed-forward networks and an additional attention layer that attends
to the encoder output.
